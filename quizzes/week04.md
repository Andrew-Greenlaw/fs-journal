# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
asynchronous code makes it so you can wait for code to responde before running the next line of code making it more functional and simpler to write but also allowing yourself to perform processes simultanously. with synchrounous its the opposite and you can only run on task at a time.
```
