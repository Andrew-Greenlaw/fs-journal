## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

- its a way to make the image encoding them strait into the code so you wouldnt have to go elsware to get the images. it turns the binary code into text format which eventually does the oposite of compressing the data but making it bigger, solving one problem and making a new one.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

- it adds up for the ammount of images you convert with base64 and the file size increases by 25% and that can add up and be more expensive. and your local computer cant cashe the images so it has to go to the server to get all of them everytime you load the images.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

- it ends up being more of a hasle to use the base 64 for larger images but you can still use it in some cases but you have to know when and its usually for really small images.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

- today we got most of the front end working and we were able to get some functions running correctly for the notifications now we really just need to make a spot on the page to draw the notifications and make a way to get rid of them i ened up kinda getting put on a new task for the forum and create your own page. those were fairly simple and i got them working but i feel like its missing more functionallity i just dont know yet because we didnt plan these pages out very well.
