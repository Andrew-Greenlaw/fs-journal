# Week 9 down

- this week was a lot of fun and way more chill than the last and i am glad i was able to relax, we were able to get evevrything we wanted to work working and we event have more stretch goals that wont brake anything if we want to get those to work. i learned that i am very capible of learning how to do things without references which really helped me understand what i can do. it gave me a confidence boost that i needed that i can do this. i am still struggling to feel like i know a lot and i often find myself confused with the terminonlogy but i am glad i can find the answers and believe in myself that i can eventually know the answers. i count that i was able to code and figure out new things this week without relying on my references im feeling more confident in my coding abilities.
