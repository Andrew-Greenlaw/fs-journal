## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

- we are making sure this week we get our notifications to work so we can implement our socket by the end of the week although it seems really confusing and we dont know how we are going to use it. and we are also making sure we are timeboxing and using the scrum sprints effectively so we can have everything finished and can focus on styling for the hackathon.

2. What went well so far?

- im really happy that we were able to get all our base functionality on all the pages and we are on track with what we are wanting to get finished. weve also been really successful in learning how to do the things that weve never done before not having any references can be difficult but it is really nice to really think of how to get it to work and think logically.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

- i think what i would have done differently was to ask more questions to the group so i could have gotten a better idea of what the whole prodject was gonna be like and i understood their thinking processes but it eventually came together.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

- notifications and working on the backend is really starting to make sense and i am glad that i was able to help patrick and not feel like i was just watching instead of not knowing what i was doing.
