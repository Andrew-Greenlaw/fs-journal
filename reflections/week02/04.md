## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

- one of the benefits of making a plan before coding is that you can have less regrets when starting to code, you will definatly need to change your plan as you go but if you get in the habit you will be more succesful and have better code in the long run. expecially with very important and harder projects that you end up having to do it comes in handy.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

- when i am stuck i will often get a second opinion or see if someone has experienced the same instance. google can be your best friend because someone has definatly done most things before i have. and its a great opritunity to understand or learn something new, and thus increase my creativity. also using my time correctly is essential if i cant find a solution to something and am getting frustrated making sure that i am keeping track of time or taking a short break or saying if i cant figure this out in said amount of time i will go ask for help.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

- the coolest things i saw in the article were first that making sure my code quality is good from the beginning so that if someone is needing to edit or maintain my code they dont hate themselves. or even my future self from hating me. and also noticing if i change something simple and it effects a bunch of things and need to change more things im not structuring my functions and code properly and should look into planning further. and also just making sure i make code work in smaller increments. i like how it said to use git and find multple solutions to a problem or do a project mulpiple times so the repition of creating things in the proper steps can save you and other a lot of trouble later. i liked how it talked about the differece of using and object and an array and knowing when to use the right one. that seems to be a big flag for newbies when people are looking to hire.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

im starting to feel like i can understand javascript a little better but i would like to have more familiarity and get used to building a structure or what i want to do in a function. but im proud of myself of taking it one step at a time and making it through this week and doing my best. i took from this project i am able to understand going through arrays and things a little easier and i understand if and for loops better aswell.
