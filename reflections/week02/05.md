## Week Two Down

- This week was great i was stressing out earlier in the week because with the pre-course work i felt i struggled with javascript and I didnt know if i would get it by the end of the week. but i ended up really enjoying my prodjects and when i started to feel creative and excited to figure out how to do a function in javascript it was a really good feeling. i was shocked that i would start to understand objects and arrays so fast i guess just coding a lot really helps. i dont know when but i just started to get it, so i am less stressed now. I struggle a litte bit with knowing how to structure my javascript i find myself going back alot and looking at references alot and redoing functions so they work more efficently. so hopefully as i do it more i will understand. i count this week as a victory because not only was i able to help others on thursday with projects i could start to understand it myself and it felt good.
