Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- today was super hard for me, it technically was the first use of javascript and i had hard time making my functions and things in a structured way so that i knew what i was doing. i found myself just staring at the page like okay where do i start or what should i do now.so im thinking i need to come up with someway to do start building something in javacript without confusing. other than that i thought what jake taught us today was super helpful and i was able to understand well. i hope i can get the help i need and become better with javascript before it gets super hard.
