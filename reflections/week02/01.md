## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

- a scope is where a variable is able to be used. sometimes it can be used on the whole thing. and sometimes when it was declared in a function it can only be accessed in that function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- Hoisting is when you call a variable or function in a scope before its been defined or executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

- let is preffered because it allows you to structure your code better in blocks and it can be updated later but not redeclared so it maked it easier to use.
