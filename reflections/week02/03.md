## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- the console.log is the easiest wat to write info to the console and track your progress in a function or values in an array or something and the errors are nice so you can pinpoint what exactly you may messed up on or scope kindof where something could be working or not working.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- the elements tab allows you to change the html and css right before your eyes and be able to structure and style a bit faster with practice. although you would need to copy your progress often so you dont loose it when you refresh or save the page. but it can really help with debugging because you can turn classed and things off with the press of a button and find what changes.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- using the debugger tool and running through your code one step at a time so you can see if something is comming up undefined or something it can really pin point if you mispelled something or broke something on accident.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- todays assignment was difficult i found myself needing lots of help just to get started but, after class i spent time working on it and eventually make some more sense of things i still am lacking when it comes to structuring out my javascript but i know even when it doesnt feel like it am learning still. so i enjoyed doing this prodject because i am learning to familiarize myself with the javascript land and also the vocabulary we use when talking about functions and stuff so hopefully i will be prepared for the checkpoint this weekend.
