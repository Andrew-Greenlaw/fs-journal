## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

- good communication in a smaller team can be difficult but if you can get it to work you can work more efficently and get to dedlines faster.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

- when and how often you need to hold meetings can really help keep people on track but also make sure you are working at a faster pace.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

- good fast cheap, good service cheap is slow, good service fast wont be cheap and fast service cheap wont be good. so the trade offs are do you want your site built fast its going to cost you and if you want it cheap its going to take longer, it really just is up to what your client pool is and how you should strive and work towards.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

- my take away from today is when we talk more and more about our plans it is contsantly changing and we dont know exactly will work but we did plan on what we wanted to get done quickly and also planned what to towards the end of our spring so we dont fall into the trap of not knowing what to do or how to do things later in the week.
