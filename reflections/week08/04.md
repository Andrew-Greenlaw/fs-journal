## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- unit testing provides that you are able to make small units of code work so you dont run into isuues later, component testing allows you to test according to specific framworks so that its features can still work and you can greater understand how to use that framwork, and end to end testingn is you living our the user story to make sure the ui and ux are what you want your application to look like and function like.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- i think the unit testing is the most important because if you dont use unit coding the whole application will not work and you wont be able to use the other testing methods without it.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- i think the component testing is the least useful because there are so many different types of frameworks for code and if you can master the other testing methods you wont have diffuculty in any of them but if you only know one component testing you wont be very effective in other codes or frameworks
