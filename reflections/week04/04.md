Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- i actually really enjoyed this prodject my partner and i got everthing done in the span of the lab which is really cool because most of the time you feel like you are moving slower. what i took away from this prodject was using parameters with the api i didnt understand how it worked at first but it was shown to me as we were trying to plan out our function. it was a lot easier than expected to get different things from the api.
