> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

- when you see a pyramid shape at the end of your code usually means you have thing inside other things that are in other things and it looks bad

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

- asynchronous means that you can make your code wait until something finishes before moving on to the next line of code. this way when you call something you dont get a callback intime because its trying to run in sync. sometimes its just not fast enough.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

-  keeping your code shallow looks like you can make code easier to read, when you reference actual function names it allows you to mive the function and reference it somewhere else.
making our lines of code shorter and smaller.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- i took away from this assignment, that this week is gonna be tough, i was confused on what asynchronous meant and how it applied in this instance of coding. im also a bit scared when we get further into the backend stuff since all this has been front-end. i worked on the assignment a couple times to see if i could understand what i was trying to do and it wasnt really helping.
