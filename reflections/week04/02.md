Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- this assignment really helped get the repitiotion down im starting to understand the await and asynchronous side although im really struggling to not feel like im just copying the references. i talked with jake and he helped me walk through my thought process a little more and i was confused and overwhelmed for a second so i felt as if i forgot everything but what i am thinking is that im thinking to much about the bigger picture and im not testing enough. i need some help getting in the habbit of smaller things of done.
