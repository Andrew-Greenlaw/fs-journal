# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

## Week 6 down

- the fact that we were able to make a checkpoint from only a few days of learning the front end framwork is kinda crazy to me. what came as a shock to me was how much i could see so many people struggling with the framework for somereason i fell like the whole thing is just way more likely to break with vue. it was very frustrating at times. and i am struggling with the new syntax and also understanding the differences in how to build out our controllers and things with it all being in one file. i found the props and computed to be very confusing so i guess we shall see if we can keep it up next week. i count that i was able to get the checkpoint done this weekend a victory i could not for the life of me understand vue and saturday night things slowly made a little sense. but i finished strong after a really tough week.
