## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

- one to one, one to many, and many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

- so that you dont run into the issue of to many things inbeded into a many relationship. and makes it so it doesnt have to load all of them everytime but rather select a few or one at a time based on what you want that way you dont reach the file limit.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

- naming things and also it gets comfusing trying to see what is in a relationship when all you see is the id until you populate it essentially.

I really used this assignment to get the repitition down I didnt want to feel like last week and I didnt because i took took the time to really do this prodject and not stress myself about it. but I enjoyed it because the back end methods make a lot more sense to me at the moment. its a little easier to format my functions and processess. i think that i am able to understand the MVC structure more and i dont dislike it, but still not in love with it haha.
