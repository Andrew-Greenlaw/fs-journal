Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- my take away from today was that i was able to finish the back end much quicker than expected with not to many bugs, but as soon as i was trying to build out the front end i ran in to bugs and things more often. knowing when to test your things can really speed up the process of debugging because you have smaller problems and not getting lost in the sauce i found myself getting in trouble when i didnte test often.
