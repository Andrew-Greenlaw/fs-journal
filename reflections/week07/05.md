# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

## Week 7 down

- i got my duckie!!! i worked really hard this week to complete the checkpoint and my hard work really paid off and im really happy about it. i learned more about vue and i was able to start writing this week and understand most of what i was writing and trying to do. the repitition is really helping alot. im still struggling with vue and how to debugg the code that i write because some of the errors and things are confusing to understand and read but i am defitally getting better everyday. This week was a huge victory because I made it through a full stack assignment and I am super happy about it. im feeling more and more of the imposter syndrome. ive come a long week in just the past 7 weeks.
