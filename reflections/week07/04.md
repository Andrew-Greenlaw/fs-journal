# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

- what i implemented this week was actually messing with jsDoc to see if it would help make my code more readable, i found that i wasnt doing all to confusing functions and didnt really need to use it all that much.

2. What went well this week?

- this week is going well because i felt like i wasnt behind and i felt like i was understanding vue a little bit more.

3. What would you do differently?

- i think what i would do differently would be planning the front end a little better and also testing more often i found myself running into bigger problems that i needed help to figure out. looking back now i sense that i made the mistake of writing multiple functions before testing my code and i need to do better at that.

## Afternoon Assignment Link

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

what i took away from today was the props and computed and when to properly use them because vue sometimes does not like it when you have both in one component. it doesnt recongnize which one you want to use and will just break but not give you any errors. i also learned in my code when to use the elvis operator because of the whole props vs computed thing.
