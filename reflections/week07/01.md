Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

we were getting graded although during lecture today we showed how we would start building a full stack application and i think it is cool that, he showed us that you can just make the back end first and then work on the front end but that isnt neccisarily the best way to do it. and ive been really trying to note each step and function to do in order to start thinking on how to build something myself i found its nice esspecially for the front end at the moment.
