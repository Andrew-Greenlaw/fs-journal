## Week 11 down

- This week was a good refresher before the final its felt like I havent done the front end in forever since we have learned c# and sql, but everything is coming together and im not overwelmed by the final. I was able to complete the backend this weekend and I am really happy about my understanding of the sql statements and joins now. I was struggling to think out some of the buisness rules and how i was going to use the front end now with a some minor changes from before when things are populated and stored differently. its interesting when you can store anything in the database as an array and its kinda difficult but i know i will get it. My Victory was being to think about and debug things in a deeper way, i Know i can master and become proficient on my own if i keep practicing some things.
