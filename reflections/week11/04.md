## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- I am really happy about my experience from codeworks I think it was the right fit for my learning, they really have a great aproach to teach you such a great amount of knowledge in such a short amount of time. I'ts intense and takes true commitment, and needs to be important to you if you wish to succeed. I feel like I have attended at the right time In my life and I am glad that I worked so hard and Pushed myself to get to this point. Im kinda sad that it has to end because I've enjoyed learning so much and about code and about myself because its hard, its a hard course and I am succeeding in something and with people with people who are a enjoy being around. There were definatly days where you felt like my brain was going to explode with stress and then days later it makes sense. Codeworks really know how it works and can get you past the biggest first humps of becoming a developer. Jake was an amazing teacher and spoke very clearly and helpfully although sometimes he can get off track or be a little strong in some things but all is well and i still am thankful. They changed a few kinks in the course and it shows sometimes if felt like the assignments werent prepared for everything but i understand it happens. My time has been spent to eat breath sleep coding like they said it would and boy were they right, and im glad i learned skills to manage my time and be most effective. My favorite part of this course was after the struggle you find this joy of overcoming great difficulty and pushing myself to be the very best that i can is very gratifying. I would recommend anyone to this course because its beautifly thought out.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today I recieved a Tutoring session on the many to many relationship and its so interesting to compare the differences of the backend in node and in .net and Its making a lot more sense how sequal works joining tables works and the how the relationships work differently from before. I am really happy that i was able to make sense of somethings before the final.
