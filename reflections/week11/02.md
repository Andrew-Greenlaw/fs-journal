## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

- a primary key is a unique key to directly identify records on a table, while a foreign key is what is used to reference a primary key on another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

- an alias is a way to save multiple saved vaules with the same key name as different keynames so that they can both be retrieved instead of it only grabing one.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

```SQL
SELECT
dp.*,
d.*,
p.*
FROM doctorsPatients dp
INNER JOIN doctors d ON d.Id = dp.doctorId
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.Id = dp.patientId
```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I still dont fully understand the many to many object and why we needed a difference from a recipe and a favoritedrecipe in allspice since and also im not completely understanding how the different joins work, although i was able to figure out some cool things on the front end like how to make a 1 to 1 ratio card that is dinamic with the screen size.
