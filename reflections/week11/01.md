## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

- inheritance alows us to not write duplicate code over and over again and to absract methods and properties that can be used in different instances.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

- member inheritance works as if the derived class is technically a base class but the inheritance and visablility can change based off of how accessable the members are set to like private or protected makes it so you cant use it the same way as a public member and unless its nested in the base class.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

- when its set to private and you try and use that in a derived class it will not compile and will inform you that it isnt accessable due to its protection level.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Allspice is a very interesting assignment the many to many object on the back end really gets you thinking on how the tables and sql database works. and the difference between mongoDb where its a document based database. I think its really cool that sql is very quick and dapper does some interesting things with the sql statements that really get you thinking how to make it work.
