## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

- it allows data to be stores localy in its object and only updated and accessed when its called to so you dont run into the problem of having too much stored in one place. i think

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

- when accessing things in a function in a scope it could mess up how you want make variables or functions that you would do normally. but it does make it private. sometimes they would get it mixed up and it would make it hard to read the code because you actually didnt know if it was a private function or not.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

- you make a function outside of the class or exported scope, you would do this when you didnt want people on the site to have access to certain functions that would mess up everything. it makes alot of sense when you are building sites that have a users information stored on so you dont get your information stolen.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- this prodject i found myself having to rely heavely on the references because i couldnt think from memory how to build the right structure, but i did find myself understanding how to start building out what i want to do on the site in stages better. like i understood what should go in the draw function and what makes that different than a add or create function. i had a hard time knowing where to start sometimes.
