> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

- it helps make a way to update the page when certain events accur.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- the bcw-template alows me to quickly and easily make event listners on the page to save and update data based on sertain actions the user makes. this alows me to keep track of the users movements and update the page only when needed. the page isnt constantly refreshing and updating but essentially accomplishing the same task just more efficiently.
