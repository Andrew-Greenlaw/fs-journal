# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

## Week Three Down
- i could understand what was being taught this week, even though it was a lot to take in i was able to understand what they said.
- it was shocking how difficult it would be to learn something so simple and helpes organize my functions. for somereason it felt like i was relearning everything i thought i was just now feeling more confident in.
- im struggling to not feel like im just relying heavely on the refrences and can code myself since this week was shorter and harder it really kindof felt like i was behind, im currently going to try and redo my prodjects so i can get in the repitition of putting functions in and exporting and importing untill i get more confident and used to it.
- i think its a victory that i was able to get the checkpoint done and have a day to just take a break and let my brain catch up and relax.
