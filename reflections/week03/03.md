Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- i found this prodject to still be hard but i was starting to see a little more how the mvc structure works and i was able to start making classes work but i still am missing a lot of the exposure to understand what is happening. but what i got out of this assignment was that this is what the structure of actuall development should look like and it looks promising for the coming few weeks.
