## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

- My favorite tips with bootstap were, how to use the dev tools to mess with the flex and figure out what tags were needed to make my code work how I wanted.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- The boostrap webdite has so many recources to use snippets of code and inegrate it into my code.

- Another recource i found benificial was material design guidlines that was a good recourse when trying to work with shadows.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- I think when a website when it is well designed can almost guide the user to do certain actions and controll what you want the user to look at. Any flaws in the structure or design could deter people from seeing a website as reliable and go somewhere else.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Boostrap is an essential tool to help with HTML and Css. It was really interesting how fast I was able to start building the structure of a webpage when as of a couple of days ago I was feeling slow and it took forever to structure a HTML document. Now im able to understand and learn a lot fast how to code and im feeling good about how fast I am learning this stuff.
