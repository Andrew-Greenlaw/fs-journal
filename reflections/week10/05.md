## Week 10 down

- this week was really good it was nice to get into a pace of learning new things again and stretching my brain again, i was missing that feeling after we were doing our capstone for a couple weeks. but i was shocked we were able to learn two languages in two days. i am just trying to get the repitition in and understand c# better the syntax i am struggling with but i know i will be able to get it. i count that i made it again throught a week and i am confident in my ability to learn and do hard things.
