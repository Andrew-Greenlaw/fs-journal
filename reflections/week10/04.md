## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

- its a group of type values that can be assigned as a symbolic name

2. How can you modify an Enum?

- you can change the value number because the enum defaults as a int and then you can choose which value you want to set.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

- we have used it to asign somone to a specific group name or how we used it in chorescore was to assign what day of the week you wanted it to be on.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- today was the first day of our checkpoint Allspice and i found that writing in c# feels like you are writing more but actually it just feels like that way becuase we have to write the queries to the database instead of relying on mongoose. i find it gratifying to know how to make our queries and have a better understanding how the database works.
