## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

- a list is a generic type so it can be anytype of value and create a list of them. kinda like an array but it stores and workes differently

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

- list add and list remove and list find because you are going to use a list the same way we used it in javascript to store different values and use them.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

- the .Find list.find(x=>x=y)

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

gregslist this time was just learning how to build gregslist backend. and it was interesting and hard to learn how to do the queries to sql, i can see how there is so much use for sql and its scary because i feel like there is so much that works differently than javascript but in a more creative way.
