## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- value, reference, and pointer types and they are different with how the information is stored and changes the way it can be used.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

- value data types are scoped in the methods and you have to return them in order to change them in other methods kinda anoying but whatevs.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

- reference types have a reference to where the value is stored and can be referenced in multiple methods and all change the value, but a value is stored without a reference and its scoped in each method and if changed in another method it will make a new copy of it instead
