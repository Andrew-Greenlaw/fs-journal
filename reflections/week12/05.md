# final week down!!

- im so happy with how quickly and effectively i was able to do the final this week and I hope to even get better so that i can be prepared for a real life work situation. it was shocking to think that i was the second student to finish the final. i really thought it would take me longer to work on one of our largest prodjects. The only thing i feel like im struggling with at this point is i need to work on more prodjects and really let some of my knowledge sink in. and also get better at coming up with new solutions to a problem without references. i think the only way to get to that point is with experience and practice so im not all to worried about it. I got the golden duck which is a huge victory if you would hava asked me at the beginning of the course if i thought i could get the golden duch i would have laughed and said no. so that fact that i managed to exceed my own expectations is incredible. im really happy with how this course has went and its been a life changing event for me.
