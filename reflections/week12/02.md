# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- Im actually making more progress than i expected that i could have gotten my first grading today based on how functional my front end is. the only thing i have to do know are some small styling changes and then i could probably be passing. Being this prepared has really made it less stressful out of all the checkpoints i found that when they announced the requirements i could find a way to accomplish all of them and wasnt stressed. the only thing that is worrying me at this point is what comes next with the finding a job and working on my portfolio and resume and things.
