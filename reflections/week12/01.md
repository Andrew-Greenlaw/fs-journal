# Daily Reflection

This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely?

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- Im actually fairly confident in my ability to finish this even somewhat early this week. over the weekend I took a total of about 10 hours or so and finished the back end so this week i really have a lot of time to work on the front end. Im really managing my stress because ive really planned out what i want to accomplish in certain time frames. and I guess the thing im most worried about would be making sure i complete all the ui requirements because it can be very easy to miss some of them if you dont go through your code and triple check sometimes.
