# Daily Reflection

Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- today i was able to get graded and i passed on the first go with 100% i was actually really suprised with myself. and now i have the rest of the week to work on my capstone and other things so no more stress here. I am excited to learn about how to set up our portfolio and get started on applying for jobs and such.
