# Daily Reflection

One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately?

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- today three out of five members of our capstone have already finished and we have been all working on our prodject getting it ready for next week when we show it off to our classmates im actually really exited to see everyones reaction and im happy with how it turned out. I feel as if i should have some more work to or maybe i have this sense of imposter syndrome because looking at the other students i feel like i should be working right along with them its really wierd to be succeeding at something I really enjoy.
